# My Data Projects

### Description
This repository contains **portfolio projects I am building independently** in the fields of **Data Analysis, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning**. Each project demonstrates practical skills, problem-solving, and insights from real or simulated datasets. The goal is to showcase my ability to apply data concepts, write clean code, and generate actionable business insights.

### Repository Structure
Each project is organized in its own folder and includes:

- **SQL / Python / Notebook files** containing the code  
- **Sample data** (if applicable)  
- **README** file describing the project objectives, questions, and insights  

Example folder structure:
